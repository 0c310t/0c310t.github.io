<p1>03/19/2018 Front End update

Added some HTML forms with categories for weapons (currently does not include shields). Minor CSS Styling for forms. !Note! The forms do not have an option for "empty" as of yet. Bit of a forgetful blunder on me... However, I will try to add this next update

What to expect next update:

Background image or color More forms for shields, armor, item slots, and attunement slots. More effecient CSS Styling Adding very basic JS and/or PHP elements

Side note: I am not an extremely experienced programmer, and most of this is me learning as I go (especially CSS). Patience is greatly appreciated, as I am a full time student on top of this project, and the semester is almost over (That means finals.) I will eventually try to get an update schedule going, and I will try to work this project into my school work. I may be distracted after May 25th with the remaster but I will try to keep the project on an equal priority as the game but no promises... the new kids need to learn who The Legend is ;P Anyhow, tips, request, or advice (programming related or not) are very much welcomed in the discussion post I posted on the Dark Souls subreddit some time back. Thanks!</p1>
